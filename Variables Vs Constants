#Variables Vs Comments
#Variables are declared in titlecase
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

#Example of variable

team1name="Spero's Stars"
team2name="Croydon Kebabs"

#Variables have a useful name
#Variables can store a value (can change)
#Variables can NOT start with a number
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Croydon Kebabs"
#This will cause a syntax error

#Variables cannot have a space in the name
#e.g. Team Name = "Croydon Kebabs"
#This will be a syntax error

#This is an exampleof a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values is a CONSTANT do NOT change
